# TODO.md
- Extract audio from GTAV for the callouts
- Optimize, Optimize, and Optimize!
- Logging for pretty much everything
- Allow players to change dialog


# Callouts
- ParkingViolation
    - Extend to spawn cars on sidewalks and not only in the middle of the road
    - Change wording to random strings like blocking traffic etc
- DUI
	- Possibly a distracted driver and not a dui (phone etc)
	- Possible flee/pursuit
- PrankCall
	- Add audio to said callout also to add immersion


- Issue with g_SpawnPoint being set as 0,0,0
